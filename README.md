# About 
People review restaurants, contractors, sites.. almost everything. Reviews make a great impact in decision-making process. Some people take advantage of it by posting fake, fabricated reviews to upvote or downvote a particular target. We are trying to approach this problem by classifying such reviews.
# Project 
By using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) Sentiment Analysis and Jaccard Similarity, a reviewer verification system is created to allocate probabilities of a reviewer being authentic, fake, or a bot. For instance, if the probability of a reviewer being fake is above 0.90, it can be safe to assume and avoid such reviews from these reviewers. For this project, we dig-in Amazon (www.amazon.com), Yelp (www.yelp.com), Facebook, and Google to apply our 'intelligent system' to classify reviews.

Detect review manipulation by leveraging reviewer historical stylometrics in Amazon, Yelp, Facebook and Google reviews

Consumers now check reviews and recommendations before consuming any services or products. But traders try to shape reviews and ratings of their merchandise to gain more consumers. Seldom they attempt to manage their competitor's review and recommendation.  These manipulations are hard to detect by standard lookup from an everyday consumer, but by thoroughly examining, customers can identify these manipulations. In this paper, we try to mimic how a specialist will look to detect review manipulation and came up with algorithms that are compatible with significant and well known online services. We provide a historical stylometry based methodology to detect review manipulations and supported that with results from Amazon, Yelp, Google, and Facebook.
